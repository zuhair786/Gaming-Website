                            You play as a worker in a futuristic cyberpunk metropolis, where everything is owned by the Ascent Group – until one day, when it collapses, and you must figure out how to survive. It’s an isometric action-RPG with plenty of enemies to mow down and rip through using meaty guns, deployable robots, and hacking augmentations.
